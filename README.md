# Mitchells-Public-Figma-Designs
These are some of my figma projects that are publicly accessible. Thank you for taking the time to stop by and check them out! 

## [Jam Sesh](https://www.figma.com/proto/PdZwQAZXU8baVBUvJH1uNq/Jam-Sesh---Mobile?node-id=1-84&p=f&t=e1ZcTsbg2sSyXHx6-1&scaling=min-zoom&content-scaling=fixed&page-id=1%3A83)
This is a project I'm currently working on that will allow users to schedule jam sessions with one another as well as allow companies to create public gig listings that users can sign up to attend.

This is a portfolio I spent some time mocking out.  I have a seperate repository where I intend to create this using Typescript, React, and the Material UI Framework.

## [Best in Boca Pet Sitters](https://www.figma.com/proto/gd2CftzKBuqETnKvx9hLS0/Best-in-Boca-Petsitters?node-id=3-2&p=f&t=OF6oIy9MIc6ldm9S-0&scaling=min-zoom&content-scaling=fixed&page-id=0%3A1&starting-point-node-id=3%3A2)
This is a website I worked on for my mother in law's pet sitting business. This was my second project using figma and it was a great opportunity to learn more of the ins and outs of the application.
